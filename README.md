![CI](https://github.com/bugbare/sl-test-fw/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Configuration
At the moment the framework has configuration for both gherkin and page objects applied to the standard Codeceptjs setup. One simple E2E test has been setup using bdd and the codecept generic dsl to compare them.
The driver being used is Selenium Webdriver, default is not headless when running locally (Chrome being used).
